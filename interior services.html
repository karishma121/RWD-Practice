<h2 class="h2">Types of Interior Design Styles</h2>
<p id="para1">Every homeowner has distinct tastes and preferences when it comes to house interior design but the interior styles typically fall into certain broad classifications. The style of a particular space is reflected in the materials, the accessories, the number of decorative elements used around the space, the furnishings and the colour scheme that dominates the space. Modern interior designs, for example, are all about natural materials and a clutter-free space. A more traditional interior design style, on the other hand, uses more decorative elements and bright colours. However, it is also important to know that these styles are not rigid and do tend to overlap.

<h2 class="h1">1.Modern Interior Design</h2>
<p id="para1">Colours, materials, the type of furniture and the kind of fabrics used for furnishings all play a role in defining what the modern interior design for home looks like. Originating in the 1950s, this style, known as mid-century modern interior design, uses neutral shades, such as whites, cream, beige, pale yellow, etc. Such kinds of spaces consciously go easy on the décor, with minimal accessories. The furniture pieces tend to be clean-cut and visually light. There is also an emphasis on ensuring that the space receives ample natural light. This kind of interior style uses a lot of natural materials, such as wood, natural stone, etc. Keeping the space free of clutter and using lighter colours are hallmarks of this style.
</p>

<h2 class="h1"> 2.Industrial Interior Design </h2>
<p id="para1"> This style emerged in urban cities in the US and UK in the 1950s when large warehouses were converted into homes. Taking their cue from the bare 'industrial' look of such spaces, the industrial interior design for home is characterised by an open-plan layout that receives abundant natural light. The style includes the use of natural material in its exposed form, such as exposed concrete or exposed red brick. Muted colours such as greys and brows, metallic accents and a fuss-free décor are elements of this style. </p>
</p>

<h2 class="h1"> 3.Indian Interior Design</h2>
<p id="para1"> Traditionally, Indian homes have always been high on accessories, bright or earthy colours, bold prints and wooden furniture. The Indian interior design style, therefore, is a reflection of this aesthetic. Creating a cosy space is integral to this kind of house design and this is typically achieved through warm colours and the display of decorative items and accessories. Natural light and tall ceilings are also typical of this style, as is intricately carved wooden furniture. This style can also be implemented in Homes interior design of modern compact cities if used correctly.</p>
